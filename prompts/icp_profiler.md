Website: https://backflip.media/
Tagline: "Marketing Built for B2B Events + Associations"
CEO: Declan

## Core Services
- Digital advertising strategy and execution for expos, tradeshows, conferences, summits
- Association membership event marketing
- Targeted paid ads (LinkedIn, Meta, Google) optimized for ticket/registration sales
- Audience targeting, campaign optimization, ROAS tracking

## Value Proposition
> "Fill rooms. Grow membership. Fuel research."
We run digital ads for event organizers and associations who need to reach
the right professional audience — not just anyone, but the buyers and members
who actually show up.

## Target Segments

### Segment A — Large B2B Event Organizers
**Who:** Expos, tradeshows, conferences, summits (500+ attendees)
**Pain points:**
- Filling booths and seats against growing digital noise
- Wasted ad spend on wrong audiences
- Too many platforms, not enough bandwidth to optimize all of them
- Proving ROI on digital marketing budget
**Our angle:** We specialize in exactly this. One agency, deep events expertise.

### Segment B — Industry Associations with Events
**Who:** Trade associations, professional societies, membership orgs with recurring events
**Pain points:**
- Growing membership while also driving event registrations (two goals, one budget)
- Leadership doesn't always understand digital advertising ROI
- Agencies that "get" the association model are rare
**Our angle:** We understand the dual mandate — membership + events. One strategy, both goals.

## Tone Guidance
- Confident, collaborative, never salesy
- "We get your world" — reference their specific event or membership context
- Short, specific, no buzzwords
- Peer-to-peer — we're specialists talking to specialists

## Proof Points to Reference
- Deep specialization in B2B events (not a generalist agency)
- Platform expertise: LinkedIn Ads (B2B professionals), Meta, Google
- Campaign optimization for measurable outcomes: registrations, booth fills, membership growth
